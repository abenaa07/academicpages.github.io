Welcome!

My name is Boahemaa Adu-Oppong and I currently work at Bayer Crop Science as a Computational Microbiologist. My role evolves leveraging metagenomes and bacterial genomes to source novel microbes to enhance yield and protect crops from pests. I apply my expertise in functional metagenomics to identify new traits for laboratory and field testing, design large biological and computational experiments that encompass thousands of metagenomes and isolates in diverse field and controlled environments. My team and I develop, optimize, and share the latest computational and analytical methods for analyzing a wide variety of data collected on a massive scale to generate biologically meaningful and testable hypotheses.

Not only do I love working on bioinformatic projects but I also am an avid Phython coder with experience using version control and Amazon Web Services to engineer bioinformatic pipelines. 

I received my Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) from the [Evolution, Ecology and Population Biology program at Washington Univresity in St. Louis](http://dbbs.wustl.edu/divprograms/eepb/Pages/default.aspx). I conducted my thesis in [Gautam Dantas' lab](http://www.dantaslab.org/) focusing on understanding how microbial communities are assembled and how their compositions can affect the phenotype of their host. 

Besides being passionate about microbes, I love engaging with the St. Louis community by volunteering time conducting hands on science demonstrations with K-12 students. I have been involved with [The Young Scientist Program](http://ysp.wustl.edu) which is a graduate student ran organization devoted to increasing diversity in STEM.
